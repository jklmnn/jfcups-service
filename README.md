Jon Freeman <http://mobd.jonbanjo.com/jfcupsprintservice/>, adaption to gradle
by Boris Kraut.

While this project builds and installs fine, the functionality is untested. I
updated and cleaned the project because I wanted to know more about the
PrinterService. Hopefully someone experienced will pick up where Jon left and
provide Android with a free/libre/open-source interface to CUPS or other IPP
printers.
